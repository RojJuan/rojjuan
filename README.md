<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Juan</h1>

When Windows broke on my machine, I installed Linux and joined many communities around it. Seeing members coding motivated me to learn coding myself (mostly backend work like Go and Python). In my time with linux, i have used Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and my most liked NixOS. I have since switched back to windows, but i'll always remember what it and it's community taught me.
